# Rigging

The nautical noun - components that support the masts and sails.

A low-dependency Go library containing simple functionality for improving tests (eg, `assert.ExpectedActual()`) and for kicking off projects (eg, `logging.FatalIfError()`). Ideally this helps reduce the number of decisions when starting a project.

**These packages may experience breaking changes, and so shouldn't be used at all.** This may change as this project evolves, but for now it is not expected to have stable APIs.
