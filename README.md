# Rigging

Rigging is a Go library containing simple functionality for improving tests (eg, `assert.ExpectedActual()`) and for kicking off projects (eg, `logging.FatalIfError()`).

These packages may experience breaking changes, and so shouldn't be used in production. This may change as this project approaches a `v1.0.0` release.
